As one of three Swedish learning games within the program, Paper Pelle enables students to practice clothing and color vocabulary through an interactive experience. Each round presents users with a new set of clothes alongside Swedish words to match. Their selections are recorded and reflected on a scoreboard, reinforcing learning through immediate feedback.
